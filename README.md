Another Team & Their UUG
========================

*Another Team* is a group consisting of Sam Elliott, Elliot Davies, and Andrei Mustata. At the DevXS conference, they came together to meet the Guardian's challenge to widen social inclusion in further education. The resulting product is *Another Team's Unofficial University Guide (UUG)*.

After careful consideration, the team decided an innovative approach would be to mix regular league table data with information that reflected what it would actually be like to live near a university. This meant that prospective students would not only be able to see how well the university performed academically, but also how well the surrounding area performed socially. To make the information as widely available as possible, a simple website format was chosen rather than technology such as a smartphone application, which might not be accessible by people from poorer backgrounds.

Much of the data used was provided by the Guardian's open data initiative and university league tables. *Another Team* took this data and pieced it together into several league tables of their own, allowing users to search by university; subject; or look at other useful and interesting information. Some of the social data chosen for each university region includes:

 * health information (e.g. self harm, teenage pregnancies, adult smokers, obesity)
 * work & benefits information (e.g. people seeking JSA, percentage of population at working age)
 * life expectancy
 * social deprivation (e.g. income deprivation, employment deprivation)

Each set of social data was collected and sorted by local area (sometimes as finely as by individual postcode), making the data not only accurate but extremely relevant to each university.

The consistent use of geolocation data also means each university can be easily found using online mapping software, and a Google Map has been embedded on each university's page for ease of use. In the future, this will be made interactive.

Several other advancements are planned for the future to further enhance the website. *Another Team* currently has a large amount of highly detailed information on specific subject and university rankings; this had not been processed by the end of DevXS but can quickly be made available. Similarly, much more social information has yet to be published, for example alcohol or fuel prices for each area. The website's Other Information section is still under construction but would include guides to finding employment that doesn't interfere with education, help with bursaries, and much more besides. There are also more immediate plans to allow universities to be ranked according to each of their academic and social criteria.

*Another Team's UUG* is an exciting step in helping students of all backgrounds, especially those for whom academia isn't everything, choose a university which is truly right for them.
